python ./setup.py test

Some modules have self-benchmarks provided.  For example, to benchmark
the cache module, do

python -OOu -c 'from pyutil.test import test_cache; test_cache.quick_bench()'

or for more complete and time-consuming results:

python -OOu -c 'from pyutil.test import test_cache; test_cache.slow_bench()'

(The "-O" is important when benchmarking, since cache has extensive
self-tests that are optimized out when -O is included.)
